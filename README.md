# Introduction
This is a release of the code of our paper **_Weakly-Supervised 3D Scene Graph Generation via Visual-Linguistic Assisted Pseudo-labeling_**.

Authors:

[[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02527)  [[code]]()

# Dependencies
```bash
conda create -n 3dvlap python=3.8
conda activate 3dvlap
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
# Prepare the data
A. Download 3Rscan and 3DSSG-Sub Annotation, you can follow [3DSSG](https://github.com/ShunChengWu/3DSSG#preparation)

B. Generate 2D Multi View Image
```bash
# you should motify the path in pointcloud2image_no_fea_match.py into your own path
python data/pointcloud2image_no_fea_match.py
```

C. You should arrange the file location like this
```
data
  3DSSG_subset
    relations.txt
    classes.txt
    
  3RScan
    0a4b8ef6-a83a-21f2-8672-dce34dd0d7ca
      multi_view_no_fea_match_top5
      labels.instances.align.annotated.v2.ply
    ...  
      
```

# Weights
